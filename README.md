KiloCrypt
===

KiloCrypt is a fork of the project Kilo.
It converts Kilo, so that it only serves as a simple text-editor, but adds 
functionality to encrypt text on the fly.

The purpose of the encryption is not to be unbreakable, but that you can blindly write
text, without anyone being able to read it.

A screencast of Kilo is available here: https://asciinema.org/a/90r2i9bq8po03nazhqtsifksb

Usage: kilocrypt `<filename>`

Keys:

    CTRL-S: Save
    CTRL-Q: Quit
    CTRL-F: Find string in file (ESC to exit search, arrows to navigate)
    CTRL-P: Encrypt/Decrypt
